This application is a Secure Password Encoder.

It takes some password provided by a user,
generates a cryptographically strong random number for the salt,
and hashes the salted password using Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).

Salted password hash along with the salt can be stored in a
database and used, for example, as part of a web application
login system.
